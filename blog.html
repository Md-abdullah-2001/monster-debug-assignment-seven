                    <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                    sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage
                    doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is
                    loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
                    particular tab

                    The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and
                    scope: how long the data is saved for and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is
                    destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, Local storage stores data with no expiration
                    date.

                    The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
                    asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the
                    event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.
                    The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                    We get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.
                    Undefined is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value
                    when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or
                    unknown value.

                    <strong>01/Firstly:</strong> it will be undefined if we do not assign any value to a variable.
                    as a result the variable has no value in it, So it is undefined.
                    <br>
                    <strong> 02/Secondly:</strong> If a function does not return any result but still we try to assign
                    its resulted value
                    to a variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.

                    <br>
                    <strong>03/Thirdly:</strong> If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will
                    have undefined
                    value.
                    <br>
                    <strong>04/Fourthly:</strong>An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression.
